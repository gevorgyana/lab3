1. Run postgres in Docker (https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)

```
docker run --name agev_postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=adminadminadmin -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

2. Important resources:
- https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/ see how a popular ORM is used and how it works
(source code)
- Metaprogramming lectures (9.*) + Python docs
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/
- https://www.psycopg.org/docs/
- https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

3. Run unit tests:
```
python -m unittest discover -s test/py2sql/
```

4. Docs were built using this guide https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59903051/sphinxs-autodocs-automodule-having-apparently-no-effect
Sphinx automatically reads the docs
It needs rst files as well as conf.py to be updated and maintained.
